# Security Notes (CSE 3000)



## Intended users

This repository is intended for use by me (the student) and the course staff for grading/review. The code and notebooks are for learning and assignments only.



## Security / privacy risks if leaked

If someone other than the intended users accessed this repository, risks could include:

- Academic integrity issues (someone copying solutions).

- Exposure of any accidental sensitive data (if I ever included API keys, tokens, private links, or personal info).

- Misuse of scripts/notebooks in unintended ways if someone ran them without understanding them.



## Steps taken to secure this repo

- I avoid storing secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) directly in the repository.

- I do not upload private datasets or personal information.

- If the repo is public, I keep it limited to course materials and do not include anything sensitive.

- If the repo is private, access is restricted to only those who need it (me and course staff, if applicable).



### Optional GitHub settings (if available)

- I can use GitHub repository rules / branch protection (rulesets) to require pull requests and prevent direct pushes to the main branch.

- Since this is a personal class repo and I am the only contributor, CODEOWNERS and strict PR rules may not be necessary, but they can be enabled for extra protection.
